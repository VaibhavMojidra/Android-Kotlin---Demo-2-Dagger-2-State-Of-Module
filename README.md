# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Dagger 2 State Of Module

Modules in Dagger 2 are used to encapsulate the creation and binding of dependencies. They can include @Provides methods that specify how to create instances of certain types. Modules can also have dependencies on other modules, which allows for composition and reuse of dependencies.

By using Dagger 2's dependency injection mechanism, you can annotate fields, constructor parameters, or methods with @Inject to indicate that Dagger should provide the necessary dependencies at runtime. Dagger 2 then generates code based on the dependency graph you define, which enables efficient and compile-time safe dependency injection.
